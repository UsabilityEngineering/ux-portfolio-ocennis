# Opening a Door

Olivia Ennis - March 7, 2023

I don't generally shop at Winco but a few weeks ago my roommate and I decided to go there to buy groceries. We went around the store grabbing the few things we needed for the week. As we neared the end of our shopping our hands were fairly full, I, in particular, only had my right hand free as we headed to get our very last item. 

The last thing we needed to get was White claws from a refrigerated section of the store. Most grocery stores have refrigerated sections where products will be placed if they need to be in a cold environment. Of course, this means doors are needed to access these products. Which is where my problem came in.

I couldn’t tell which side of the door had the handle. The design wasn’t very **effective** in communicating to me how to open the door. Even after getting close, it was difficult to see where I was supposed to grab. I assumed if I just grabbed around I would find it. I first grabbed the left side of the door, which I then found out was the hinge. I assumed my problems were over so I went to grab the handle on the right side with my right hand. I hit curved plastic, not the handle. Due to general grocery store door **conventions**, I assumed the handle was able to be grabbed from the right and left sides. This was not the case.

I then tilted my head to see that the handle was curved plastic that could only be grabbed from the left side. My **mental model** of how I assumed the door would open was different from the **conceptual model** of how to actually open the door. Most grocery stores have handles that are easily visible and that are open on both sides which caused my confusion.

I **recovered from my initial error**, however, because my left hand was full this meant I had to open the door with my right hand at an uncomfortable angle. This made the interaction much less **satisfying** because I was being forced to adhere to the inflexible nature of the design. I believe Winco’s designers were attempting to create a door that looked aesthetically pleasing and they didn’t much think of the practicality of this choice. Although I do think this interaction is **learnable** I still think my experience would’ve been much more positive without having to use trial and error. 

If they still wish to keep this more flush clean looking design then I would suggest the handle be grey so that it can still stand out against the black door. Additionally, I suggest the handle should be less curved so as to not hide the pocket where your fingers go. But even better than that I would suggest they change the handle to be accessible using both hands coming from either side.
